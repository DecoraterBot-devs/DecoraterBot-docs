### Patching or fixing Command Documentation

So, you patched an existing Command's Documentation or Added Documentation to a command that was forgotten in the Documentation? Excelent.

However does it meet these requirements?

- [ ] Does it provide an description of the command and the command name with how to invoke it (if the command takes arguments).
- [ ] Does it separate commands per cog file (so it can help stop confusion when bot says the command does not exist).

And do not forget a brief description on what your changes/submissions do here.
